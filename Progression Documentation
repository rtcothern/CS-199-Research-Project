1. Switching gears to altered format of game
2. Much time is spent on dynamic determination of effects of Actions on Goals and how this should be implemented in code.
	2.a Initial implementation utilized inheritance, and required a new class for each Goal and Action. Determination of the effect an Action had on a Goal involved
		a large amount of passing of control back and forth between a Goal and an Action, and changes to the interface required large changes across multiple classes

		This was necessary initially as Goals and Actions needed specific pieces of information in order to evaluate each other.

	2.b Secondary implementation involved enums to identify what type a Goal or Action is. This was deemed impossibled in version one because of the specific information requirement.
		However, version 2 bypasses storing this specific information in the Goals or Actions, and will obtain this info directly from the Bots involved
